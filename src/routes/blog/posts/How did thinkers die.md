Learning about a philosophy entails learning about the philosophers from which their ideas were constructed. Professor James Porter, in the context of discussing Lucian critique on the passing of Peregrinus, said "look at how philosophers die it's very important". For Lucian and Peregrinus, Lucian was critiquing Peregrinus that his death was in service of fame not praxis (the process by which a theory, lesson, or skill is enacted, embodied, realized, applied, or put into practice). In a sense Peregrinus "turning into fire", while intended to immortalise like how Socrates drinking hemlock, because of it's motivation made him into a joke. His entire essence was not in service of knowledge or wisdom but it was the appearance of knowledge of wisdom. The argument follows that Peregrinus saw the societal standing of Socrates, saw his universal admiration and immortalisation and coveted them, he thus attempted to _preform_ the same actions he did in order to gain the same social and historical value. The difference between the two thus seems to be that Socrates drank the Hemlock and did not escape (Apology and Crito) in order to serve virtue and continue on being a little shit (pestering people) in the underworld. Peregrinus jumped into the fire as a performance of his philosophy not as a practice, given that he waited for people to amass before he jump into the fire.

This is a really fucky idea because Lucian himself conveyed his views as satire, or technically as a epideictic oratory, praising and blaming people in theatrical displays. His accusation of anti-praxis behaviour or "hollow philosophy" in Peregrinus is thus contradictory as the argument could be applied back to him. Lucian preformed his philosophy (if he even had one) rather than lived it. This doesn't seem to be the case, as a "cynic" the theatrical harassing/embarrassment of people could be seen as praxis. However it does seem weaker than Diogenes masturbating in the market or Crates and Hipparchia having sex in public. Or my favourite story of courtship in history: when Hipparchia insisted on following Crates and marrying him, he stood up, removed all his clothes in front of her, and said something to the effect of: "This is your bridegroom, this is all he possesses. Make your choice accordingly." He deliberately displayed his hunched back, poverty and general diseased appearance, essentially saying "this is what you're getting." They then ended up marrying. That level of dedication to their philosophy seems to be what Lucian is demanding.

In summation Lucian is examining the motivations or the will or a philosopher to preform an action, or writing a work. If an action is done not for the sake of knowledge or virtue, then it is done in vanity. I don't like this argument for many reasons.

Firstly, it means that if I say I am a Kantian or a Humian or a Christian or a Utilitarian that means any time I am not acting in accordance with that doctrine I am being a bad person. I despise ideology as internalising as a fraction of your identity imposes constraints on your set of action. That power it would hold over me to announce that would be limiting my knowledge and dictating my action. For example those who see astrology as doctrine and accurate life advice allow themselves to be controlled by it. As astrology is a forgotten epistemology and now largely meaning taking life advice from an app, the owner of that app pretty much dictate your life along with others who with the same information can manipulate you with rhetoric that appears to support the prescriptions of astrology while really serving their own self-interest. Astrology could be replaced by virtue/knowledge or libertarianism or religion or nationalism etc.

Secondly, and most importantly I feel is the smoking doctors argument (a la Richie Kim). It goes while smoking a cigarette with your doctor, your doctor could say to you "cigarettes contain numerous harmful chemicals, including tar and nicotine, which damage your lungs, heart, and other organs by causing cancer, constricting blood vessels, and impairing your body's ability to absorb oxygen. You should probably stop smoking". The fact that the doctor is also smoking does not invalidate his claim. Appealing to identity or history as a method for invalidating claims is stupid. It's the same issue with cancel culture, just because Kanye has said and done the things he has done, it does not mean that his music is bad. Heidegger was a bonafide nazi, does that make phenomenology false. Historical narratives can be useful for understanding the motivations of people. Kant was aspergers af thus his systematic, inductive examination of reason to derive moral principles makes particular sense when he preferred solitude but needed to develop explicit logical frameworks to navigate social interactions. Calling Kant a tismo tho does not invalidate the categorical imperative, as a rhetorical tool it can admonish his character and dissuade people from taking him seriously, but is not a logical negation.

So looking at the death of philosophers is not really important in the question gaining knowledge. This doesn't make it not fun, here is a list of some important thinkers and how they died. Some of them are deaths of praxis, others random.

- **Socrates** (470-399 BCE, aged 71), forced to drink hemlock after being convicted of corrupting the youth of Athens and impiety. Most famous case of praxis till the end.
- **Confucius** (551-479 BCE, aged 71-72), died naturally of old age.
- **Buddha** (Siddhartha Gautama) (c. 563-483 BCE, aged around 80), died after accepting a meal from a blacksmith, possibly containing spoiled food. He reportedly knew the food would cause his death but accepted it anyway. Ensured his teachings would live on after, by waiting to die and letting people come and visit him before passing.
- **Plato** (428/427-348/347 BCE, aged 80), died peacefully in his sleep after attending a wedding feast, like the pussy he was.
- **Diogenes** (412-323 BCE, aged 89), held his breath or ate a raw squid. This does have importance but Diogenes is a theatrical figure. His entire life was a performance to look at how absurd and heardish people were. So it checks out.
- **Aristotle** (384-322 BCE, aged 62), died of stomach issue. Although he did flee from Athens after the death of Alexander after being charged with impiety saying "I won't let Athens sin twice against philosophy". He died the following year but his fleeing from Athens and not accepting justice does show he served knowledge rather than the polus or the social contract. Also being Macedonian he didn't have the same loyalty as Socrates did.
- **Epicurus** (341-270 BCE, aged 71), died from kidney stones after enduring tremendous pain.
- **Cicero** (106-43 BCE, aged 63), brutally assassinated on Mark Antony's orders after opposing him politically. His hands and head were cut off and displayed in the Roman Forum. His death symbolised the violent end of the Roman Republic he had tried to defend, with his severed hands that wrote against tyranny and his tongue that spoke for liberty being particularly targeted.
- **Seneca** (4 BCE-65 CE, aged 68), forced to commit suicide by Nero, slitting his wrists and taking poison, did it with dignity. Good stoic.
- **Hypatia** (c.370-415 CE, aged c.45), brutally murdered by a Christian mob in Alexandria, torn to pieces with pottery shards.
- **Ibn Sina** (Avicenna) (980-1037, aged 56), died of colic after attempting to treat himself with extreme methods, ironically succumbing despite being one of history's greatest physicians and medical philosophers.
- **Niccolò Machiavelli** (1469-1527, aged 58), died after receiving the last rites of the Catholic Church, a conventional Christian death that means nothing if not contradicts his philosophy. Though it wasn't really his he wrote The Prince for the the prince to gain favour. Maybe a Protean figure.
- **Thomas More** (1478-1535, aged 57), beheaded for refusing to accept King Henry VIII as head of the Church, reportedly saying "I die the king's good servant, but God's first". Good man.
- **Giordano Bruno** (1548-1600, aged 51), burned at the stake by the Roman Inquisition for heresy, refusing to recant his cosmological theories and philosophical views, becoming a martyr for intellectual freedom. He was also a dickhead (meaning insulting to those in power) tho and much like Galileo was probably the reason for their punishment not necessarily Heliocentric views.
- **Francis Bacon** (1561-1626, aged 65), died of pneumonia contracted while experimenting with snow preservation, literally sacrificing his life in the pursuit of scientific knowledge.
- **Thomas Hobbes** (1588-1679, aged 91), died from a stroke, pretty unremarkable.
- **Spinoza** (1632-1677, aged 44), died of lung disease (likely tuberculosis) exacerbated by inhaling glass dust from his lens-grinding work.
- **John Locke** (1632-1704, aged 72), died peacefully of natural causes, with his death having little symbolic connection.
- **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** (1646-1716, aged 70), died largely alone and unrecognized, with his funeral reportedly attended only by his secretary.
- **Voltaire** (1694-1778, aged 83), died after returning to Paris in triumph after 28 years of exile, with his final months seeing him celebrated by admirers. On his deathbed, when asked to renounce Satan, he reportedly replied, "This is no time to be making new enemies," pretty legendary. The man would also have like 50 espressos a day, he liked it with chocolate.
- **Adam Smith** (1723-1776, aged 67), died after a painful illness, having instructed his friends to destroy most of his unpublished manuscripts.
- **Jean-Jacques Rousseau** (1712-1778, aged 66), died of cerebral hemorrhage after a walk.
- **Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804, aged 79), died quietly of old age after a life of legendary routine and regularity.
- **G.W.F. Hegel** (1770-1831, aged 61), died during a cholera epidemic, being seemingly random and having no meaning and purpose, the irony!
- **Jeremy Bentham** (1748-1832, aged 84), per his instructions, was dissected in public, and his preserved body (with wax head) remains on display at University College London. Although the head on the body is a fake one because the it would get stolen so much. Rumour has it that the Imperial boys would steal it and rape it. It was replaced with a wax head as the head was discoloured and stretched.
- **John Stuart Mill** (1806-1873, aged 66), died in Avignon, France, with his stepdaughter by his side. Why was he in France?
- **Arthur Schopenhauer** (1788-1860, aged 72), died in his apartment after suffering a heart attack.
- **Karl Marx** (1818-1883, aged 64), died of pleurisy sitting in his armchair, a rather ordinary end for someone whose ideas would dramatically transform world politics.
- **Fyodor Dostoevsky** (1821-1881, aged 59), died from a pulmonary hemorrhage caused by emphysema, having faced a mock execution earlier in life.
- **Friedrich Nietzsche** (1844-1900, aged 55), died after a decade of mental illness and physical deterioration, with his philosophical warnings about nihilism ironically preceding his own mental collapse. He famously witnessed a coachman beating a horse in the street, overcome with emotion, Nietzsche ran to the horse, threw his arms around its neck to protect it, and then collapsed.
- **Oscar Wilde** (1854-1900, aged 46), died in exile in Paris from cerebral meningitis, destitute and disgraced after his imprisonment for homosexuality, his last words were about the wallpaper: "Either that wallpaper goes, or I do."
- **Leo Tolstoy** (1828-1910, aged 82), died at a remote railway station after fleeing his home in his final days.
- **Franz Kafka** (1883-1924, aged 40), died from tuberculosis after requesting that his friend Max Brod burn all his unpublished manuscripts—a request Brod famously ignored giving us some of the greatest fiction in history.
- **James Joyce** (1882-1941, aged 58), died after surgery for a perforated ulcer.
- **Vladimir Lenin** (1870-1924, aged 53), died after multiple strokes left him severely disabled, with his body subsequently embalmed and displayed in a mausoleum.
- **H.G. Wells** (1866-1946, aged 79), died of an unspecified sickness.
- **George Orwell** (1903-1950, aged 46), died of tuberculosis shortly after publishing "1984," marrying Sonia Brownell on his deathbed. Too good for him to not die alone.
- **Ludwig Wittgenstein** (1889-1951, aged 62), died of cancer, with the manner of his death being unremarkable compared to his revolutionary approach to language and philosophy.
- **Alan Turing** (1912-1954, aged 41), died from cyanide poisoning, widely considered suicide following his chemical castration by the British government as punishment for homosexuality.
- **Albert Camus** (1913-1960, aged 46), died suddenly in a car accident, a random, absurd death.
- **Ernest Hemingway** (1899-1961, aged 61), died by suicide with his shotgun. There is so much more to say about this man but legendary. Please read into him.
- **Sylvia Plath** (1932-1963, aged 30), died by suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning by putting her head in an over!!! She left bread and milk for her children in another room. What a legend.
- **Aldous Huxley** (1894-1963, aged 69), died on the same day as JFK's assassination, after requesting and receiving LSD on his deathbed, still tripping while he died. Again Legendary.
- **Che Guevara** (1928-1967, aged 39), executed by Bolivian forces after being captured, with his final words being "I know you've come to kill me. Shoot, coward, you are only going to kill a man." Another legend.
- **John Steinbeck** (1902-1968, aged 66), died of heart disease in New York City, far from California.
- **Theodor Adorno** (1903-1969, aged 65), died of a heart attack in the Swiss Alps, shortly after an incident where female students exposed their breasts to him during a lecture, causing him significant distress in his final months.
- **Bertrand Russell** (1872-1970, aged 97), died of influenza.
- **Hannah Arendt** (1906-1975, aged 69), died of heart attack.
- **Michel Foucault** (1926-1984, aged 57), died of AIDS, very on topic.
- **Guy Debord** (1931-1994, aged 62), died by suicide, shooting himself in the heart after years of alcoholism and depression, a final gesture of refusal
- **Robert Nozick** (1938-2002, aged 63), died of stomach cancer.
- **David Foster Wallace** (1962-2008, aged 46), died by suicide after struggling with depression and attempting to wean himself from antidepressant medication
