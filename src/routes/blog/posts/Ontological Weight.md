Ontology is a field of philosophy that posses an illusory quality due to it's degree of abstraction. My specific question is what is truth and what is reality?

I would like to posit the metaphor of 4D gravity, substituting mass for ideas. Normal gravitational representations in 4D space look like this.

The depth of the "well" is determined by the objects mass, each object itself carrying a degree of gravity. Einstein showed us that gravity distorts time, thus the dip in space time shows the adoration the body has on a objects situated within it's gravitational well.

Substituting for for ideas we can establish each idea or concept as having it's own weight or reality or gravity which we will use to represent it's power. Giving credence to an idea gifts the idea your power, those with little power do nothing to affect an idea, leaders of institutions, or speakers for social bodies, carry with their words the weight of all of their constitutes and resources. The ideas can be subsumed by others, as in every Republican is a racists or all Liberals are gay and soft. The abstract categories attract and borrower from the weight of other ideas. The liberal and republican are not the abstract quality, but the negative attributes ascribed to the idea are. We see this in advertising, where someone like Ryan Reynolds can slap his image or the idea of him onto any product and push it closer to the "good" gravitational wells. This works in the opposite way as well Mr Reynolds can claim an idea is bad an push it the other way.

Ontological weight can be subtracted over time, but it is incredibly difficult. In modern marketing and didactic communication the market dictates what ought to be ethical, which is whatever makes money. An example would be recent attitudes to DEI, the repetition of images where people of colour, different sexual orientations and backgrounds are venerated not denigrated has allowed DEI to reach escape velocity and fly out of the gravitational well of the bed. Other things that have been mythologised like the constitution is constantly amended to always be relevant to the cultural ethic.

It is crucial to understand our plane of reality is our personal map of gravitational idea. What an agent conceives as truth is simply their socially constructed reality, always formed outside of the agents will. No one chooses to be born, or to be taught things in infancy which irreparably shape our moral convictions, but here we are contingent creatures exploring our made up reality.

This is normally where social most people stop there, ideas have power which through rhetoric we can transfer but only personally. DEI is not accepted by most and is actually seeing a popular counter moment from within left leaning crowds against it. In this moment we are seeing a society of critique sprung about by the catalyst of conservative government. This goes behind DEI to every facet of society which the Orange Man is currently diving his paws into. Is DEI good? Should the US do aid? Is unemployment or the stock market more important? Are trade deficient natural for global economies? Should Universities be a place for political action?

In asking these questions holes in the order we have imposed on reality begin to show up. In the moment before critique, DEI was absolutely good/bad because the images you saw reflected that notion, change in the idea creates a discord leading to an agent remapping the ethics of that idea and thus mutating it's gravity.

I am proudly saying what is good is natural and what is bad is whatever impedes natures goal. Love is natural, regulated love not so much. A society (polis) contingently creates convention, unfortunately there are some fucking dumb dumb who set conventions with no basis in reality or reason. These faulty ideas are contingently strengthened and then canonised and then mythologised and fictionised (obfuscating the reason) to the point where it is concretely good and a moral rule we use to evaluate people.

    A stupid moral rule is monogamy.
